## Zen of Wearables ##

* Lighter is better than heavier
* Smaller is better than bigger
* Flexible is better than rigid
* Be resistant without compro*mis(s)ing* durability
* Be secure! People will wear it: No Booms or Zaps!
* Energetic efficiency is a must
* Simple is better than complex (Borrowed from Zen of Python)
* Design is not just what is looks like and feels like. Design is how it works (Steve Jobs)

* Field tests (in Alaska) makes perfect.
